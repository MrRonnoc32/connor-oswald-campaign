                        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">Connor is a dedicated public servant, a proud Floridian, and a researcher who believes in the power of community. With a Ph.D. in Education Policy and Evaluation from Florida State University, a Masters of Arts in Teaching from the University of North Florida, and years in the classroom, he has seen firsthand the challenges our families face.</p>
                        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">He's running for the Florida House of Representatives in District 13 to bring common-sense solutions to Tallahassee. He will fight for economic and educational opportunities for the next generation, affordable housing for all, lower cost healthcare and ensure that every voice in our district is heard.</p>
                        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600">Beyond his work, Connor spends his time connecting with his community and digging into the data to find solutions. He knows our community's strengths because he has been a part of it his entire life.</p>

                        <h2 class="text-3xl font-black text-blue-primary mb-4">Early Years</h2>
                        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">As a 7th-generation Floridian, Connor is aware of where weâ€™ve been, sees the trouble of where we are now and knows how to get where we want to go. He was raised by his mother who worked her entire career for the Internal Revenue Service in the Whistleblower Division, ensuring that everyone, no matter their income or social status, would pay their fair share. His father was a Naval Helicopter Pilot and JSO officer until his incarceration.</p>
                        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600">Connor's commitment to public service began early. In his church, the core concept of social justice, that we belong in and of a community and have the responsibility to take care of our neighbors was central. During high school at Stanton College Preparatory School, he was introduced to the concept of 'Ubuntu' by Principal Majova-Seane. This philosophy, that our own humanity is tied to the humanity of others, deeply shaped his worldview and reinforced his belief in the power of community.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600">This belief was tested when he began his career as a Physics and Marine Science teacher at William M. Raines High School. There, he encountered systemic challenges that stacked the deck against student success. For instance, with 200 students to start the year between six classes, he was given a printing limit of just 500 pages for the entire year, 2.5 pages a year. Witnessing firsthand how these obstacles, and more, were stacked against students and teachers solidified his resolve to fight for equitable resources and dismantle the barriers preventing every child from achieving their potential.</p>

                        <h2 class="text-3xl font-black text-blue-primary mb-4">A Record of Service</h2>
                        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600">From serving as a secondary science teacher to managing data and research for the Jacksonville Public Education Fund, Connor has always stepped up to get things done. His approach is simple: listen, organize, and deliver real results. As a manager, he conducted quantitative analysis for community programs and oversaw the evaluation of several projects. While at Orange County Public Schools, he managed the project evaluation of several external programs and spearheaded an overhaul of the nationwide research request process. Prior to his work in Orlando, while working for the Texas Education Agency, he worked to create the Texas Education Exchange by writing bylaws that guided the organization from concept to a program connecting 5 of the largest educational service centers across Texas.</p>

They cherish Florida's natural beauty and are committed to preserving it for future generations. They are driven by a shared dream to see all kids, parents and families in their community receive an equal shot at dreaming big dreams.</p>
